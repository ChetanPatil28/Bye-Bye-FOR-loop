# Bye-Bye-FOR-loop
A jupyter notebook where-in i perform operations such as Convolution, MaxPooling on 1D and 2D arrays

Normally, whenever we like to implement Convolution operation over a series of data, we use FOR loops from Python.
which is very time consuming.
Here, i use a method from Numpy called stride_tricks to efficiently elimintate the necessity of using FOR loops.
I use this method to implement functions such as Convolution and Max-Pooling.
As of now, my code only support GrayScale images. 
I'm also thinking of implementing the code for multi-chanelled images as well.
